The FEWS Agent is an intelligent food security analysis platform that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide real-time insights into famine and food insecurity conditions. The system combines official IPC (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification) data with fast-moving signals like commodity prices, conflict reports, and weather data to create a comprehensive monitoring and analysis tool. Instead of waiting for quarterly IPC reports, analysts can ask natural language questions like "Why is Tigray in Phase 5 famine?" and receive intelligent responses that synthesize information from multiple sources, including historical context and real-time developments.

The system uses a vector database (Qdrant) to store embeddings of food security documents, enabling semantic search that understands meaning rather than just keywords. When a user asks a question, the system converts the query to a vector embedding, searches through thousands of documents to find relevant information, and then synthesizes this with real-time data to provide contextual answers. For example, when asked about Tigray's famine conditions, it might return the official Phase 5 classification along with recent price spikes, conflict incidents, and historical analysis showing similar patterns from previous crises. The platform serves as a complementary intelligence layer that enhances official IPC processes by providing faster, more contextual analysis that helps analysts make better-informed decisions about food security interventions and early warning systems.
