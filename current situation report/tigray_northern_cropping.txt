NORTHERN CROPPING AREAS (TIGRAY AND AMHARA) - MANUAL REGIONAL CONTEXT

Source: FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook (October 2025, adapted from page 4-5)
Region: Tigray and Amhara highland zones
Livelihood System: Rainfed cropping (highlands above 2000m elevation)

CURRENT SITUATION:

Agricultural Production Status:
- The green meher harvest is underway, though sorghum development is delayed in areas of Tigray and Amhara due to the late onset of June to September kiremt rains
- Moisture deficits in late-planted fields are expected to constrain production, particularly for sorghum in Tigray highlands
- Notably, in Tigray and South and North Wello zones of Amhara, dry spells are driving below-average meher production
- In other areas moisture deficits may be partially offset by September rains

Conflict Status (Post-2022):
- Insecurity has declined overall relative to previous years; however, localized clashes in Tigray and Amhara intermittently impede trade flows and block major roads
- Insecurity is driving increases in market prices, particularly in remote areas
- Previously displaced populations are slow to return to their places of origin
- Employment opportunities remain below pre-conflict (2020-2022) levels

Labor Market Impacts:
- In Amhara and Tigray, labor migration to their respective western sesame-producing zones has declined due to conflict-related constraints
- Reduced seasonal labor migration options have pushed many Tigrayan youth toward precarious gold mining or irregular migration to Arab countries

Market Access and Trade:
- Fuel shortages (particularly in Tigray) impede assistance distributions and normal market functioning
- Security constraints in Amhara and localized insecurity in Tigray intermittently block major roads
- These blockages drive increases in market prices, particularly in remote highland areas
- Transport constraints reduce market access for household income and food purchases

Food Security Status:
- Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are widespread in areas where the harvest is delayed or households face conflict-related disruptions to their livelihood activities
- Phase 4 (Emergency) conditions possible in severely affected zones with both production deficits and market disruptions

KEY DRIVERS OF FOOD INSECURITY IN TIGRAY HIGHLANDS:
1. Weather: Delayed kiremt rains (Jun-Sep 2025) causing late planting and moisture deficits
2. Conflict: 2020-2022 conflict legacy constraining labor migration, employment, and trade
3. Economic: Fuel shortages and market disruptions driving high food prices
4. Market Access: Road blockages and transport constraints limiting income and food purchasing
